Introduction
	The video game industry has experienced dramatic changes over time. Currently a number of major players including Sony, Nintendo, EA, Microsoft and etc. dominate the revenue of the game industry. This study shows the trend of the game sales over time and discusses descriptive models for game sales of global, north american and japanese game market in an attempt to provide information for the video game sales business.

Data acquisition
The raw data can be found in Kaggle dataset (link: https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales/data#). The dataset contains the fields include ranking of overall sales (top 16600), the game name, platform of the games release, release year, game genre, game publisher, sales in North America, Europe, Japan, the rest of the world in millions, and total worldwide sales. 
The data does not include enough number of observations after the year of 2017.

Descriptive Statistics
The original dataset has 16,598 observations.

Figure 1. Descriptive Statistics Table

The descriptive statistics of the raw data shows that sales in North America counts the most in the market share, therefore it is important to know the market trend of North America for the game companies to succeed.

Data Processing
As the main focus of this study is to describe the recent game market to provide insight for video game sales, the data prior to the year 2011 is opted out. As the raw data does not contain enough records for analysis after the year 2016,  only data between the year 2011 to 2015 are taken out. 3538 observations from the raw data are obtained after the extraction for years.
Also, the data was extracted for the five most popular game genres including Sports, Action, Shooter, Role-Playing, and Platform only.
In addition, dummy variables for descriptive modeling were added based on the exploratory data analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis


Figure 2. Global Sales by Genre and Year

 In order to concentrate on features shared among games with high sales, the data is extracted for year 2011 and 2015, and five game genres including Sports, Action, Shooter, Role-Playing, and Platform.
As the total game sales significantly declined between 2011 and 2012 and continues to drop until 2015, sales of all game genres decreased throughout the years but sports.



Figure 3. NA Sales by Genre and Year

While Action and Platform game sales experienced a significant drop, other genres are relatively staying flat in sale over the years.


Figure 4. JP Sales by Genre and Year

In Japanese game market, Role-Playing has been the most popular game genre for over all time. However, the recent sales data shows that it is not as popular as before 2014 and sales of action games is replacing the place. 

Figure 5. JP Sales by Genre and Year

As the graph shows in the above, Electronic Arts and Activision are dominating the market followed by Ubisoft and Nintendo. In contrast, Nintendo monopolizes the video game market of Japan.

Figure 6. Nintendo vs. Electronic Arts, Sales by Genre over years
				
As itâ€™s shown in the figure 6, The top three genres of game sales for Nintendo are Role-Playing, Platform, and Action games. On the other hand, the most Electronic Arts (EA) game sales are from Sports, Shooter, and Action. The japanese game market behaves differently from other markets.  Nintendo sold Role-Playing games twice more than Platform games in Japan. In contrast, EA has most of the game sales from the Shooter genre and also, the absolute number of EA game sales is significantly lower than Nintendo in Japan. 

Figure 7. Game Sales by Consoles in Global, NA, and JP

In Japan, games published in 3DS records the highest sales. XBox 360 is the most popular platform with top game sales in North America and Playstation 3 has the top game sales in the global game market. 

Descriptive Modeling
Two descriptive methods, logistic regression and Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS) were employed to construct models in an attempt to describe the global, north america, and japan game market. 
For the logistic models, dummy variables are created for the games having the cumulative sales higher than mean values between 2011 to 2015 ( Global sales > 0.523, NA sales > 0.222, JP sales > 0.064).

Global Sales Model
Based on the information from the exploratory data analysis, EA, Shooter, and PS3 dummy variables are included for the global market model. 


Figure 7. Global Sales OLS Model Report: Mean Absolute Error: 0.5028919325862423, Mean Squared Error: 0.9290539170663538, Root Mean Squared Error: 0.9638744301341092

 Figure 8. Global Sales Logit Model Report and ROC curve: AUC score: 0.626223360468307

Based on the information from the exploratory data analysis, EA, Shooter, and PS3 dummy variables are included for the global market model. The R-squared value of the OLS model is 0.18 which tells that the model can explain only 18% of the sample. It also has a very high error rate.
 In the logistic model, the very high AIC and BIC scores and very low R-squared indicate that the model is not robust to describe the games with sales over sales mean.


NA Sales Model

Figure 9.NA Sales OLS Model Report: Mean Absolute Error: 0.22917447944088568, Mean Squared Error: 0.2265415900666995,Root Mean Squared Error: 0.4759638537396506



	 Figure 10. NASales Logit Model Report and ROC curve: AUC score: 0.6293507326405495

	The NA Sales model includes Shooter, XBox 360, and EA variables. The NA models show very similar results to the global sales models with a slightly lower error rate of approximately 0.48. 











JP Sales Model

	 Figure 12. JP Sales Logit Model Report and ROC curve: AUC score: 0.6832163679550852

Independent variables including 3DS, RPG, and Nintendo are incorporated into the model for the JP market.
The models perform better as the OLS model has higher R-squared value with 0.271 although the error rate is not very improved compared to the models for the NA and global market. Meanwhile, the logit model for the JP market has lower AIC and BIC scores as well as higher AUC value. This tells that the models for JP Sales explain the market better in comparison to the models for North America and global game sales.


Conclusion and Future Directions

The objective of this study is to determine the features shared among games with high sales.
The exploratory data analysis in this study revealed some information of the game sales. For example, in North America, EA and Activision are the two most popular game publishers and Action and Shooter games are sold much higher than other types of games. Also, XBox 360 is slightly more popular in North America while PS3 games are sold better in global sales. Japanese market shows unique features as Nintendo is almost monopolizing the market with Role-Playing games and 3DS is the most popular console in the market.  However, given the raw data includes a limited number of observations and variables, the models created are not robust to perform the task, although the models for the Japanese game sales performs slightly better than models for other regions.
The models in this study interact only with publisher, year, console, and genre. However, there are many other features such as studio, promotion, and review score. The models of this study miss lots of information which may have led to large error rates, but if more information is given, could produce notable improvements to the models.
